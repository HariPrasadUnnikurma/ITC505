  <h1>Lab-3: Delivering a Custom Font</h1>

  <article>
    <p>
      According to my research there are lot of methods to deliver the fonts to a browser to make a request to the server. 
      I found the most common,easy and flexible way is to use an online font service. Here I selected <strong>Google Fonts</strong>. 
      The files related to the fonts are hosted on Google’s servers, and I have included a reference link 
      to fetch the font when the browser loads this page. 
    </p>
    <p>
      After downloading, the browser applies this font to the text styling here, 
      even though it is not installed on the user’s computer. This makes the code WORA (Write Once, Read Anywhere) which is the core concept of this lab work.
The noticeable thing with this font is : it is designed to make all the characters to convert to uppercase even if it written in lower case. you can observe here that all the characters are uppercase. In the backend I have used only lower case characters.
      This makes the code WORA (Write Once, Read Anywhere) which is the core concept of this lab work.

      For this assignment, I selected the font <em>“Eater”</em>. 
      I believe this font is not common,unique and rarely found on other computers.
